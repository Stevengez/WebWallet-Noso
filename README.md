# WebWallet Noso

Webwallet base on [Nosowallet-Android](https://github.com/Noso-Project/NosoWallet-Android) and [NosoLite](https://github.com/Noso-Project/NosoLite).

This is a web solution to interact with the noso mainnet.

You can check your balance, create new addresses, import/export existing ones and send noso.

It can run on any compatible browser (any browser but IE should work, however has been fully tested on chrome only).

## Running the wallet

This solution doesn't need installation, just download the latest release and open the index.html file using a compatible browser.

```

For live testing/debugging you can run:
