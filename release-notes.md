## Version 1.1.6
- Moved the host from vpn in azure to a container app to reduce costs and have a valied signed cert to avoid https issues (https://nosotranslator-container.wittymeadow-b1aa8a5a.centralus.azurecontainerapps.io)
- **Webwallet doesn't upload any information to the cloud, manages all the information and task locally and therefore you should use it carefully (make sure to save any new address created here)**
